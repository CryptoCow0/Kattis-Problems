line sgement.

edge cases:



make the lines

is parrllel:


find y intercepts if parrlel and if not the same then line segments don't ineresect else




if (l1.sameAs(l2)):
the overlap is always one of the four points given such that p1 is always left to p2 and p3 is left p4

if you sort the points then osrt hte lines 
start will always be be p3
end will be min (p2, p4)

if start == end
print(start)

else
print(start,end)
